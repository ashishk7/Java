# Problem Description:

Write a program to check whether the given string is a palindrome or not. Return True if it is palindrome else return False.

>[!Note]
> A string is said to be a palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as the string itself.

## Input Format:

```java
First line will have the number of test cases. For each testcase there will be single line of input consisting of a string.
```
## Output Format:

```java
True if palindrome else False
```
### Sample Input 1:
```java
1
level
```
### Sample Output 1:

```java
True
```
## Sample explanation:
```java
'level' when reversed returns 'level' only which are same therefore True is returned.
```
### Sample Input 2:
```java
1
Hello
```
### Sample Output 2:
```java
False
```
## Sample explanation:
```java
'Hello' when reversed returns 'olleH' which is not equal to original string therefore False is returned.
```
