# Problem Description:

Write a program that returns the list of elements that are present in the given list and are divisible by 5 and 7.

## Input Format:

```The only argument is the given list of elements```

## Output Format:

```Return a list consisiting of the elements that are divisible by 5 and 7 from the given list.```

## Sample Input:

```java
[23, 34, 25, 35, 66, 70, 14]
```

## Sample Output:

```java
[35, 70]
```

## Sample explanation:

```java
Only 35 and 70 are divisible by 5 and 7 from the list [23,34,25,35,66,70,14]
therefore the list consisting of only these two elements is returned.
