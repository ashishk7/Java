## Problem Description

You are given two integer matrices A and B having same size(Both having same number of rows (N) and columns (M). You have to subtract matrix B from A and return the resultant matrix. (i.e. return the matrix A - B).

If A and B are two matrices of the same order (same dimensions). Then A - B is a matrix of the same order as A and B and its elements are obtained by doing an element wise subtraction of A from B.


### Problem Constraints

1 <= N, M <= 103

-109 <= A[i][j], 

B[i][j] <= 109



### Input Format

The first argument is the 2D integer array A

The second argument is the 2D integer array B


### Output Format

Return a 2D matrix denoting A - B.



### Example Input

#### Input 1:

A =  

[[1, 2, 3],

[4, 5, 6],

[7, 8, 9]]

B =  
[[9, 8, 7],

[6, 5, 4],

[3, 2, 1]]

#### Input 2:

A = [[1, 1]]

B = [[2, 3]]


### Example Output

#### Output 1:

[[-8, -6, -4],

[-2, 0, 2],

[4, 6, 8]]

### Output 2:

[[-1, -2]]

#### Explanation 2:

[[1, 1]] - [[2, 3]] = [[1 - 2, 1 - 3]] = [[-1, -2]]
