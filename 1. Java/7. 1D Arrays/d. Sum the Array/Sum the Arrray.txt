Problem Description
Write a program to print sum of elements of the input array A of size N.

Note: the size element is removed from the list passed as input to the function main,
that is only elements are present. User is supposed to add them up and return the result

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= A <= 1000

Input Format
A list of length N

Output Format
A single integer containing sum of elements from the input array.

Example Input
Input 1:
5 1 2 3 4 5
Input 2:
4 10 50 40 80

Example Output
Output 1:
15
Output 2:
180

Sample Explanation:

Input-1:
A = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
here the first element is the size of A and the remaining elements are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
which all sum to 15

Input-1:
A = [4, 10, 50, 40, 80]
here the first element is the size of A and the remaining elements are [10, 50, 40, 80]
which all sum to 180
