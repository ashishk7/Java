Problem Description
Write a program to input N numbers array, a number X and a number Y from user and insert an element Y in it at specified position X. X is based on 1-based indexing

Note: When an element is inserted at position X, all elements that were already present at position >= X, gets shifted to one position right, not replaced.

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= A[i] <= 1000
1 <= X <= N
1 <= Y <= 1000

Input Format
First line is N which represents number of elements.
Second line contains N space separated integers.
Third line is X position where Y has to be inserted.
Fourth line is Y which is the value to be inserted.

Output Format
N+1 space separated integers of the input array after inserting the element at required position.

Example Input
Input 1:
5
2 3 1 4 2
3
5

Example Output
Output 1:
2 3 5 1 4 2

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Clearly after inserting 5 at 3rd position, new array is 2 3 5 1 4 2.
