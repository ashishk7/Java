Problem Description
You are given a positive integer A denoting the radius of a circle. You have to calculate the area of the circle.
Note :
The formula for the area of a circle is Area = πr², where r is the radius of the circle.
You can use the value of PI as 3.1416
Round up the final answer up to 2 decimal places.
You can use round(area, 2) it for rounding area to 2 decimal places

Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 1000


Input Format
First and only argument is an integer A.

Output Format
Return final answer upto 2 decimal places, denoting the area of the circle.

Example Input
Input 1:
8
Input 2:
15

Example Output
Output 1:
201.06
Output 2:
706.86

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
r = 8
Area = πr²
     = 3.1416 * 8 * 8
     = 201.0604
     = 201.06 (upto 2 decimal places)
Explanation 2:
r = 8
Area = πr²
     = 3.1416 * 15 * 15
     = 706.86
