# Problem Description:

Write a program that returns the product of all elements present in the array.

## Constraints:

```java
1 <= |A| <= 100
1 <= A <= 100
```
> [!NOTE]  
> It is guaranteed that the resultant product will be <= 1015


## Input Format:

```
An integer array **A** as the function argument.
```
## Output Format:

Product of elements in integer format

## Sample Input:

```java
A = [7, 9, 2, 51]
```
## Sample Output:
```java
6426
```
## Sample explanation:

```java
The product of all the elements is 7 * 9 * 2 * 51 = 6426 is returned.
```
